# image-inpainting


The program is referenced from [Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1211538)

The main difference in this code is that it only consider to remove the rectangle region.

By doing that,we only need to handle four normal vector directions( (0,1),(1,0),(-1,0),(0,-1)) which reduce the difficulty of implementation to leetcode easy problem, joy!
